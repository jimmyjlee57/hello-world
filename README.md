GitHub Tutorial

Learning how to (officially) use GitHub for the first time. Previously, I've used GitHub for a class but only on a surface level without really trying to see exactly how it works.

As of the time this was written, I have learned the languages (chronological order) Java, C, C++, Assembly (ARMv7), Python, and C# (surface level).
